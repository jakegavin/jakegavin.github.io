I grew up in Ashland, OR where I attended [Ashland High School](http://ashland.k12.or.us). While at AHS, I was on the water polo and played French in the [Youth Symphony of Southern Oregon](http://ysso.org). After graduating in 2010, I attended [Whitman College](https://www.whitman.edu) where I studied physics and astronomy. I swam on the swim team and was a member of Phi Delta Theta.

Once I completed my degree December 2013, I playing around with web development. I completed the [Tealeaf Academy](https://launchschool.com/)'s Ruby On Rails program (note: Tealeaf rebranded as LaunchSchool). In April 2014, I moved to Seattle, WA and started an apprenticeship at [Planning Center Online](https://get.planningcenteronline.com).

Working at Planning Center Online has been a blast. We move quickly, developing great products using exciting technology while maintaining a phenomenal company culture. At PCO, I've worked on [Check-Ins](https://get.planningcenteronline.com/check-ins), [Resources](https://get.planningcenteronline.com/check-ins), and [Transposr](http://transposr.com/). I primarily work with Rails and React but have also gotten to play around with Go and Elixir.

When I'm not tinkering with software, I enjoy getting outside. I love exploring the rivers in the Pacific Northwest in my kayak and skiing with friends at local mountains. This past year, I've also gotten back into rock climbing and mountain biking.
